# Table Sampling

To support table sampling, similar to the Postgresql and T-SQL syntax, a TABLESAMPLE clause has been
encorporated into the table aliases ref as of Phoenix 4.12. The general syntax is described
[here](/docs/language/index#aliased_table_ref). This feature limits the number of rows returned from
a table to a PERCENT of rows. See [PHOENIX-153](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-153) for
implementation details.

This feature is implmented with a Bernoulli trial, a consistent-hashing based tablesampler, to achieve a 
Bernoulli sampling on a given population (rows). When executed, given a sampling rate, it leverages Phoenix's 
stats as well HBase's region distribution to perform a table sampling.

As part of the [statistics collection](/docs/update-statistics), a guide post (a row referrence) is created for
rows at equidistant bytes from each other.  When sampling is required, a Bernoulli trial process is applied
repeatedly on each guide post on each region with a probability that porportional to the sampling rate. A
included guide post will result in all the rows in between this and next guide post being included into
sample population.

#### Performance
Sampling on a table with a sampling rate = 100% will cost same amount of computational resource as a query without sampling. 
This resouces consumption quicky fall off when a smaller sampling rate is choosing. In general,
the amortized complexity for sampling process is `O(k + mn)` , with n being the number of the regions of the sampled hbase table,
m being the number of guide posts, and k being the size of sampled population.

 
#### Repeatable
Repeatable means it guarantees that the repeated sampling on the same table will resulted in the same sampled result.

Repeatable feature is made possible by a consistent-hashing process applied on the binary representation of the 
start rowkey of each guideposts of each region when sampling process is in action. During hashing, 
a FNV1 implementation with lazy mod method is adopted by default. see [FNV1](http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/).


## Examples

For example, to tablesample a table , you would execute the following command.
Please note, the sampling rate is a numeric value between 0 and 100, inclusive.

    select * from PERSON TABLESAMPLE(12.08);

Some more examples:

    select * from PERSON TABLESAMPLE (12.08) where ADDRESS = 'CA' OR name>'aaa';
    select count( * ) from PERSON TABLESAMPLE (12.08) LIMIT 2
    select count( * ) from (select NAME from PERSON TABLESAMPLE (49) limit 20)
    select * from (select /+NO_INDEX/ * from PERSON tablesample (10) where Name > 'tina10') where ADDRESS = 'CA'
    select * from PERSON1, PERSON2 tablesample (70) where PERSON1.Name = PERSON2.NAME
    select /+NO_INDEX/ count( * ) from PERSON tableSample (19), US_POPULATION tableSample (28) where PERSON.Name > US_POPULATION.STATE
    upsert into personbig(ID, ADDRESS) select id, address from personbig tablesample (1);

To use it in aggregation:

    select count( * ) from PERSON TABLESAMPLE (49) LIMIT 2
    select count( * ) from (select NAME from PERSON TABLESAMPLE (49) limit 20)

To explain the query:

    explain select count( * ) from PERSON TABLESAMPLE (49) LIMIT 2)



## Tuning

* Due to sampling process, the TABLESAMPLE clause should be used with some caution. 
For example, a join of two tables is likely to return a match for each row in both tables; 
however, when tablesampling process is applied on either one or both of the two tables, the joining
may not match the expectation when without sampling.

* The stats needs to be collected in order to achieve the best sampling accuracy. To turn on statistics collection, refer to [Statistics Collection](/docs/update-statistics).
 
   <pre>
   ALTER TABLE my_table SET GUIDE_POSTS_WIDTH = 10000000
   </pre>
* A denser guide post setting improves the sampling accuracy, but reduces the performance at the same time. A comparison 
is experimented as fig below:
