# Python Driver for Phoenix

The Python Driver for Apache Phoenix implements the [Python DB 2.0 API](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/) to access Phoenix via the Phoenix Query Server. 
The driver is tested with Python 2.7 and 3.5-3.8. This code was originally called [Python Phoenixdb](https://code.oxygene.sk/lukas/python-phoenixdb) 
and was graciously donated by its authors to the Apache Phoenix project.

All future development of the project is being done in Apache Phoenix.

## Installation

### From PyPI

The latest release is always available from PyPI, and can be installed by
pip/pip3 as usual.


```
pip3 install --user phoenixdb
```

### From source

You can build phoenixdb from the official source [release](.html), 
or you can use the latest development version from the soure
[repository](/docs/source). The pythondb source
lives in the `python-phoenixdb` direcory of the python-queryserver
repository.


```
$ cd python-phoenixdb # (Only when building from the git repo)
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python setup.py install
```

## Examples

```
import phoenixdb
import phoenixdb.cursor

database_url = 'http://localhost:8765/'
conn = phoenixdb.connect(database_url, autocommit=True)

cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR)")
cursor.execute("UPSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?)", (1, 'admin'))
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
print(cursor.fetchall())

cursor = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=phoenixdb.cursor.DictCursor)
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1")
print(cursor.fetchone()['USERNAME'])
```
