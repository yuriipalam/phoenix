At Bloomberg, patterns of access to financial datasets are diverse and complex. HBase provides the scalability and strong consistency that our use cases demand. However, we need more than a key-value store. We need ANSI SQL to reduce the barriers to adoption, we need features such as secondary indices to support lookups along multiple axes and cursors to handle UI pagination. Apache Phoenix provides a rich set of capabilities above HBase that makes it a critical piece of our data platform.

![eHarmony logo](/images/using/eharmony.png)

At eHarmony, Apache Phoenix serves as an SQL abstraction for the HBase storage where we maintain details about potential relationship matches identified for our users. We store presentation-ready user match feeds in HBase, and serve the data to one of the most visited pages on [eharmony.com](http://www.eharmony.com). Apache Phoenix helped us to build a query abstraction layer that eased our development process, enabling us to to apply various filters and sorting on the aggregated data in the HBase store.

> "The integration with Apache Phoenix has not only stabilized our system, but also reduced response time for loading hundreds of matches on a page to below 200ms."

![Sogou logo](/images/using/sogou.png)

We adopted Apache Phoenix since 2015, mainly for two scenarios:

1.  Business Intelligence: We use HBase+Phoenix to store billion records of our Ad Exchange, thanks to the SQL abstraction and secondary indexes of Phoenix, we can provide multidimensional statistical and analytical reports to our advertisers, empowering them with thorough insight to make the intelligent decisions maximizing their investment revenue.
2.  Technology Infrastructure： Our Monitoring Platform and Distributed Service Tracing Platform uses HBase+Phoenix to continuously collect various metrics and logs(about 100k records per second at present) ,and with the high performance of Phoenix we can easily generate statistics for our system operation health measurement and service dependency analysis.

![HomeAway logo](/images/using/homeaway.png)

Apache Phoenix enables easy integration with HBase for systems that rely on JDBC/SQL. HomeAway, the world leader in Vacation Rentals, leverages Phoenix as a SQL abstraction for HBase's powerful columnar storage to generate statistics for vacation rental owners on HomeAway's Owner Dashboard. These statistics help HomeAway vacation rental owners gain key insights about the performance of their vacation rental, how well it is doing against 'the market', and how well it is doing historically.

From a pool of billions of records that go back 2 years, HomeAway is able to serve up customer-facing webpages from HBase, using Phoenix, in less than a second for the majority of our vacation rental owners. With Phoenix and HBase, HomeAway is able to share the same insight it has internally on the vacation rental market to its owners empowering them with the necessary data to make the right decisions maximizing their return on their vacation rental investment.

![Sift Science logo](/images/using/ss.png)

At Sift Science we use Phoenix to power our OLAP infrastructure. This influences our machine learning feature engineering which is critical in the model training pipeline. Having a simple SQL-based interface also allows us to expose data insights outside of the engineering organization. Finally, running Phoenix on top of our existing HBase infrastructure gives us the ability to scale our ad-hoc query needs.

![Alibaba logo](/images/using/ab.png)

At Alibaba there're two main scenarios of using Phoenix:

1.  Large dataset with relatively small result set, say 10 thousands of records or so. We choose to use Phoenix in this kind of scenario because it's much more easier for user to use than HBase native api, meantime it supports orderby/groupby syntax
2.  Large dataset with large result set, it might be millions of records in the result set even after PrimaryKey filter, and often along with lots of aggregation/orderby/groupby invocation. We choose to use Pheonix in this kind of scenario because Pheonix makes it possible to do complicated query in HBase, and it supports more and more features in traditional DB like oracle, which makes it much more easier for our user to migrate there BI query onto HBase

![ebay logo](/images/using/ebay.png)

We have been exploring Phoenix since July, 2014 and have successfully achieved couple of analytics use cases with huge data set. We were able to achieve read/write performance in ms even slicing and dicing data in many dimensions.

1.  Path or Flow analysis
    This use case was very specific and targeted for core mobile native apps where we were trying to find user behavior with many dimension App, Version, device , OS version, carrier etc. This was offline process where we process and aggregate daily data and load once in phoenix schema.
2.  Real Time analytics data trend.
    This is near real time aggregation of tracking data to find trend of events with multi-dimensional. It does write aggregated data to hBase + Phoenix continuously (at present 12k-15k/s records) and read for report generation at the same time.
